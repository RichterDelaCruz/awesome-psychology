## Books
  - [How Pleasure Works: The New Science of Why We Like What We Like](https://www.amazon.com/How-Pleasure-Works-Science-Like/dp/0393340007)  
  Why is an artistic masterpiece worth millions more than a convincing forgery? Pleasure works in mysterious ways, as Paul Bloom reveals in this investigation of what we desire and why. Drawing on a wealth of surprising studies, Bloom investigates pleasures noble and seamy, lofty and mundane, to reveal that our enjoyment of a given thing is determined not by what we can see and touch but by our beliefs about that thing’s history, origin, and deeper nature.
  - [Just Babies: The Origins of Good and Evil](https://www.amazon.com/Just-Babies-Origins-Good-Evil/dp/0307886859)  
  A leading cognitive scientist argues that a deep sense of good and evil is bred in the bone.
  - [The Denial of Death](https://www.amazon.com/Denial-Death-Ernest-Becker/dp/0684832402)  
  Winner of the Pulitzer prize in 1974 and the culmination of a life's work, The Denial of Death is Ernest Becker's brilliant and impassioned answer to the "why" of human existence. In bold contrast to the predominant Freudian school of thought, Becker tackles the problem of the vital lie -- man's refusal to acknowledge his own mortality. In doing so, he sheds new light on the nature of humanity and issues a call to life and its living that still resonates more than twenty years after its writing.
  - [The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil](https://www.amazon.com/Lucifer-Effect-Understanding-Good-People/dp/0812974441)  
  The definitive firsthand account of the groundbreaking research of Philip Zimbardo—the basis for the award-winning film The Stanford Prison Experiment.
  - [The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat: And Other Clinical Tales](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Mistook-His-Wife/dp/0684853949)  
  In his most extraordinary book, “one of the great clinical writers of the twentieth century” (The New York Times) recounts the case histories of patients lost in the bizarre, apparently inescapable world of neurological disorders.

- [PSYC 110: Introduction to Psychology](http://oyc.yale.edu/psychology/psyc-110)  
What do your dreams mean? Do men and women differ in the nature and intensity of their sexual desires? Can apes learn sign language? Why can’t we tickle ourselves? This course tries to answer these questions and many others, providing a comprehensive overview of the scientific study of thought and behavior. It explores topics such as perception, communication, learning, memory, decision-making, religion, persuasion, love, lust, hunger, art, fiction, and dreams. We will look at how these aspects of the mind develop in children, how they differ across people, how they are wired-up in the brain, and how they break down due to illness and injury.

Also examined are problems such as malnutrition, eating disorders, and the global obesity epidemic; the impact of food advertising aimed at children; poverty and food; and how each individual's eating is affected by the modern environment.
